# autohotkey-config

This is just a set of [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
hotstrings I like to use in Windows.  There's also a hotkey to reload.

You're welcome to peruse it and copy things from it.

It is subject to change from time to time according to my maniacal
whims.

## Setup

-	Open this folder in Explorer.

-	Press `Win+R` then type `shell:startup` then press `Enter`.

-   Hold down the right mouse button while dragging `shortcuts.ahk`
    from this folder to the `shell:startup` folder.  Release the right
    mouse button, and select the option to create a shortcut.

-   Now you automatically has your autohotkeys after you logs in.

## Making Changes

-   After editing `shortcuts.ahk`, press `Win+Shift+A` to reload.
